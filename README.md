# AlbumSplitter
![AS Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/igtampe/AlbumSplitter/master/Images/Sample.png)
AlbumSplitter is a utility to split long MP3 recordings of albums (like from Cassette rips) into individual, labeled, and ready for archive/use files. Using the power of FFMPEG (Not included for legal reasons), Album splitter dynamically detects silence to split tracks, and makes it easy to manage relevant MP3 tags of the whole album.
Then, when you're ready to export, hit start. FFMPEG will then be used to generate individual MP3s from the recording, and then tagged. 

From there, you're ready to use the MP3 files in your player of choice, and transfer to your phone, computer, or other device.

### Disclaimer
AlbumSplitter is not intended for ilegal use. Only use this on recordings of music you already own, and want to archive or make a secure copy of (IE from tapes you bought or own).
